# artist-gallery
**A stunning full page artist gallery with scrollable thumbnails and a scrollable full screen preview.**

## Introduction
> The idea is to have a thumbnails bar at the bottom of the page that scrolls automatically when the user moves the mouse.
> When a thumbnail is clicked, it moves to the center of the page and the full screen image is loaded in the background.
> The user can now move up and down and the image will get scrolled automatically, giving him the opportunity to see all of the image.
